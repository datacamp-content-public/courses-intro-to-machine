Hi ! This course will teach you how to build a explainer for xgboost model in R. The explainer will help explain how the model is using each feature and give you a way to quantify them to show to your boss or co-workers.

Interpretable models means we can quantify the effectiveness between each features with the target values. For example, linear model is an interpretable model because the relationship between a feature and the target outcome always goes in the same direction over the entire range of the feature,which means an increase in the feature value either always leads to an increase or always to a decrease in the target outcome.
